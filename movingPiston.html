													<h3>Master Sketch</h3>
												</header>
												<p>The master sketch was cloned and added to each seperate body. When skecthing and extruding around the clone, certain elements were imported so I could constrain my skecths to the cloned skecth. This way, everything moves with the master sketch.</p>

													<h3>Piston Pin</h3>
												</header>
												<p>The physics of the piston took some time. If I used my nut and bolt design to connect the arms, the piston would not move as it is constrained. The designed piston pin acts as a joint rather than a just a fastener. This way, the motion of the piston is realistic and constrained to the master sketch.</p>

													<h3>Goals and Proceedure</h3>
												</header>
												<p>This piston is one of my more complex FreeCAD projects with several elements. My main goal of the project was to create a piston that could be animated with Python. Being able to see how the actual design moves as intended is an integral part of any engineering procedure. On top of good practice, I wanted to combine my coding skills and 3D modeling skills into one example.</p>
												<p>I went about the project using a skeleton master sketch. By making a bare master sketch, I could extrude more detailed and complicated parts to a kinematically correct sketch. Once the master sketch was manipulated, the whole piston would move with correct constraints. By constraining the main arm to the y-axis and to the wheel, the piston would move vertically when the wheel spun. After finalizing the design, I wrote a Python macro that moved the angle of the wheel with the x-axis every second which would automate the spinning of the wheel.</p>
												<p>The first main problem encountered was trying to add more details, such as a piston pin, to the skeleton sketch. Because the master sketch was in 2 dimensions, it was difficult to add details that weren't on the same plane. I was ultimately able to work around this by connecting a datum plane to an element of piston that was already constrained to the master sketch. Since the datum plane referenced a moving part, when the arm of the piston moved, so did its piston pin.</p>
